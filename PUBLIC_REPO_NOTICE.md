# ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL PLAYGROUND - RESETS NIGHTLY

## Welcome to OnaFlix Public!

This is an **experimental playground** version of OnaFlix. Here's what you need to know:

### 🔄 This Repository Resets Every Night

- **Every night at 2 AM UTC**, this repository is force-pushed to match the private source repository
- **All changes made here are temporary** and will be wiped during the nightly reset
- This is intentional! It allows you to experiment freely without consequences

### 🎮 Feel Free to Experiment

- Fork this repo and submit PRs
- **PRs can be merged freely** - no strict review process needed
- Try out ideas, test features, break things
- Learn by doing without fear of breaking production

### 💾 Want Your Changes to Persist?

If you create something valuable that should be permanent:

1. Document your changes clearly
2. Reach out to the maintainers of the private repository
3. They can review and merge your changes into the source of truth
4. Your changes will then appear here after the next nightly sync
