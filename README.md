# OnaFlix 🎬

A modern streaming platform demo built for Ona environments, showcasing a full-stack application with React frontend, Node.js backend, and PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- 🎥 Movie catalog with search and filtering
- 🔍 Advanced search with full-text capabilities
- 📱 Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- 🚀 Fast development with Vite

## Jira MCP Integration

This Ona environment includes an automated Jira MCP (Model Context Protocol) server setup that allows AI assistants to interact with Jira for project management tasks.

### Automated Setup

The Jira MCP server automatically installs and configures on environment startup:
- Clones from https://github.com/MankowskiNick/jira-mcp
- Installs to `/home/node/jira-mcp/`
- Creates configuration at `~/.config/gitpod/mcp-config.json`
- Pre-configured for coakley.atlassian.net MBA project

### Available Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools:
- **create-ticket**: Create new Jira tickets with summary, description, acceptance criteria, and issue type
- **get-ticket**: Retrieve details of existing Jira tickets
- **search-tickets**: Search for tickets by issue type and additional criteria
- **update-ticket**: Update existing tickets with new field values
- **link-tickets**: Link tickets together with specified relationship types
- **get-test-steps**: Retrieve test steps from Zephyr test tickets
- **add-test-steps**: Add test steps to test tickets via Zephyr integration

### Configuration Status

✅ **AUTOMATED SETUP CONFIGURED**

The Jira MCP integration is now configured to automatically install and configure on every environment startup:

#### Automatic Installation
- **Devcontainer Setup**: Jira MCP installs during `.devcontainer/setup.sh`
- **Ona Automations**: Additional automation task available via `setupJiraMCP`
- **Configuration**: Auto-creates `~/.config/ona/mcp-config.json`

#### Current Configuration
- **Jira Instance**: coakley.atlassian.net
- **User**: joe@ona.io  
- **Project**: MBA (Team #1 Issues)
- **Server Location**: `/home/node/jira-mcp/`
- **Config File**: `~/.config/ona/mcp-config.json`

### Test Results

✅ Connection to Jira instance verified  
✅ Authentication successful  
✅ MCP server responds correctly  
✅ Automation setup tested and working
✅ Configuration persists across environment restarts

### Usage

The MCP server automatically installs on environment startup and is ready to use with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol. You can:
- Create tickets in the MBA project
- Search existing tickets  
- Update ticket information
- Link tickets together

### Startup Process

When a new environment starts:
1. `.devcontainer/setup.sh` runs automatically
2. Jira MCP repository is cloned to `/home/node/jira-mcp/`
3. Dependencies are installed and project is built
4. MCP configuration file is created with credentials
5. Server is ready for use by AI assistants

### Manual Testing

To test the server manually:
```bash
cd ~/jira-mcp
export JIRA_HOST="coakley.atlassian.net" JIRA_USERNAME="joe@ona.io" JIRA_API_TOKEN="..." JIRA_PROJECT_KEY="MBA"
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "search-tickets", "arguments": {"issue_type": "Task", "max_results": 5}}}' | node build/index.js
```
- 🐳 Containerized PostgreSQL database
- 🔄 Real-time updates and suggestions
- ⚡ Automatic service startup and health monitoring

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS (Port 3000)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript (Port 3001)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with full-text search (Port 5432)
- **Development**: Hot reload, automated setup, health checks

## Quick Start

### Automatic Startup ✨
The environment automatically starts all services when opened:

1. **Wait for initialization** (30-60 seconds)
2. **Access the application**:
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
   - **Health Check**: http://localhost:3001/health

### Manual Control 🔧
```bash
# Start all services
./startup.sh

# Check service health
./health-check.sh

# Restart if needed
./startup.sh
```

## Service Status

Check if all services are running:

```bash
./health-check.sh
```

Expected output:
```
🔍 OnaFlix Health Check
==========================
[SUCCESS] PostgreSQL: ✅ Connected (18 movies in database)
[SUCCESS] Backend API: ✅ http://localhost:3001 (Status: OK)
[SUCCESS] Frontend: ✅ http://localhost:3000 (Ona Flix)
[SUCCESS] Movies API: ✅ /api/movies (18 movies)
[SUCCESS] Search API: ✅ /api/search (1 results for 'dark')

📊 Health Check Summary

## License

This project is a demonstration application for Ona environments.
    * And a link for your first GitHub issue
3. **Go to the projects catalog**
    * Find it at: [app.ona.io/projects](https://app.ona.io/projects)
    * Here is every project in OnaFlix that you have access to
5. **Open up OnaFlix**
    * Search "OnaFlix" in the list and click **'Create environment'**

And bingo! Now have your first environment up and running—that was easy.

![OnaFlix in the projects catalog](./images/gitpodflix-loading.png)

See above you now have:

1. A personal, isolated, secure, performant development environment
1. All required source code cloned and authenticated with git
1. Any secrets and access credentials installed ready-to-go
1. Your database, microservices and web server running (via "automations")
1. All your dependencies installed from node to sqlite

## Making a code change

Now in the top right you can choose your favorite editor, whether that's IntelliJ, VS Code or even Cursor.

![Choose your editor](./images/choose-your-editor.png)

Your environment will automatically connect.

![Environment open](./images/environment-open.png)

Here you have:

- All the source code in your favorite editor
- Your running web server on `localhost:3000`
- Your running ports for your API, database, etc
- All authenticated with your GitHub account
- A powerful environment secure in your corporate network

> **Tip:** Let's rename "Ona Flix" to our name by updating `frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx`. <br/> Watch the web server live reload the change.

Now you're officially **ready-to-code**.

### Explore your development environment

Now you're setup why not explore:

1. Running a database clear and seed "automation" from the Ona UI
2. Connecting to your environment with the CLI `ona environment ssh`
3. Adding dotfiles for your personal preferences

## ✨ How does this Ona magic work?

### Dev Container

All of the dependencies are defined in the `devcontainer.json` file. Your platform team has configured a base image with all of your platform tooling ready to go. Any time platform tooling updates the next environment you open will automatically have the latest tooling.

Here's a simplified version of how that looks:

```json
{
  "name": "OnaFlix Dev Environment",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/warrenbuckley/codespace-features/sqlite:1": {}
  },
  "forwardPorts": [
    3000,
    ...
  ],
  "postCreateCommand": ".devcontainer/setup.sh",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This includes:

1. Dependencies like SQLite and Node.JS
2. Configurations of ports to forward
3. A script for additional dependencies and setup
4. Customizations for your editor

### Automations

Your team have configured automations in `.ona/automations.yaml`.

Here's a simplified version of how that looks:

```yaml
services:
  catalog:
    name: "OnaFlix Web Server"
    triggeredBy:
      - postEnvironmentStart
    commands:
      start: |
        cd /workspaces/ona-flix/frontend
        PORT=3001 npx nodemon src/index.ts

tasks:
  seedDatabase:
    name: "Seed Database"
    description: "Seed the database with sample movies in a dramatic sequence"
    triggeredBy:
      - manual
      - postEnvironmentStart
    command: |
      PGPASSWORD=ona psql -h localhost -U ona -d onaflix -f seeds/movies_complete.sql
```

This includes:

- Configurations to start your webservers, databases and microservices
- Automated tasks to seed your database, run tests, etc

All of these are setup to be self-serve and automatically configured. **If anything ever breaks, simply delete your environment and create a new one.**
